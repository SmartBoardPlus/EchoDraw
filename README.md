# EchoDraw

## üí° Inspiration

As students, we‚Äôve all experienced classrooms where engagement fades quickly ‚Äî students hesitate to participate for fear of making mistakes, and teachers struggle to identify learning gaps in real time. We were inspired to create **EchoDraw** to make classrooms more interactive, anonymous, and insightful. By blending collaborative whiteboarding with real-time feedback, EchoDraw helps teachers **see what students are thinking** without the pressure of raising hands.

## üîç What it does

**EchoDraw** allows teachers to create lessons composed of **digital whiteboard questions**.  
Students can **join a lesson using a unique code**, respond on their own **digital whiteboards**, and **submit their answers anonymously**.  
Teachers can then:

- **Shuffle through responses** to identify common misconceptions.
- **Annotate directly on submissions** to highlight and correct mistakes.
- **Compile all responses into a single PDF** and export it to their digital classroom platform for review or sharing.

The result is a more **engaged classroom**, **faster feedback loops**, and **deeper learning**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

Frontend:

- **React + Nextjs + TailwindCSS** for building a responsive, intuitive, and modern user interface.
- **Excalidraw** to power the interactive digital whiteboards, enabling smooth drawing, real-time updates, and annotation features for both students and teachers.

Backend:

- **Supabase** handles user authentication, whiteboard data synchronization, and database storage. It allows lessons, student submissions, and annotations to be stored and retrieved efficiently, while keeping setup and integration lightweight.

## ü™¶ Challenges we ran into

- **Integrating the backend with the frontend** proved more complex than expected. Setting up seamless communication between React and Supabase required careful structuring and debugging.
- We faced **version control and synchronization issues**, which occasionally led to merge conflicts and slowed down development as we coordinated changes across the team.
- **Integrating Excalidraw** into our project also presented some hurdles ‚Äî especially around customizing its features to fit our lesson and submission workflows smoothly.

## üòÅ Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Creating a **fully functional and practical digital classroom tool** during the hackathon.
- Implementing a **whiteboard system** that‚Äôs lightweight yet feature-rich.
- Seamlessly integrating **PDF generation** for lesson summaries.
- Achieving a **smooth teacher-student workflow** from lesson creation to feedback export.

## üìñ What we learned

Throughout the development of EchoDraw, we gained valuable experience in **frontend‚Äìbackend integration**, especially when connecting React with Supabase for real-time functionality. We learned how to manage **version control collaboratively**, resolving conflicts and keeping our workflow organized. Integrating **Excalidraw** taught us how to adapt external libraries to fit our specific use case, customizing its features for classroom interactions. Overall, we improved our ability to **work as a team under time pressure**, build efficiently with new tools, and structure a project from idea to functional prototype.

## ü§î What's next for EchoDraw

**Analytics Dashboard**: Provide teachers with insights into common mistakes, participation rates, and progress trends over time.

**Multi-Lesson Support**: Allow teachers to save and reuse lessons, enabling more structured course planning.

**Handwriting Recognition**: Use AI to parse handwritten answers, allowing for auto-grading or feedback suggestions.

**Integration with LMS platforms**: Seamless export to Google Classroom, Canvas, or Microsoft Teams.

**Mobile App Version**: Extend EchoDraw to iOS and Android for increased accessibility across devices.
